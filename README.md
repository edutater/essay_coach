Admissions Essay Reader
An interactive web application that provides instant, AI-powered feedback on college admissions essays. This tool simulates feedback from both a discerning Admissions Director and a supportive Essay Coach, tailored to the selectivity of the user's target university.

Description
The journey of applying to college is often stressful, and the personal essay is one of the most critical components. This application is designed to demystify the essay review process by providing students with realistic, constructive feedback from two key perspectives. By selecting a university's selectivity level, students can get an idea of how their essay might be perceived by admissions committees at different types of institutions, from large public universities to the most competitive Ivy League schools.

Features
Dual AI Personas: Get feedback from two distinct AI-driven viewpoints:

Admissions Director: Provides a high-level, candid assessment based on the chosen school's selectivity.

Essay Coach: Offers actionable, encouraging advice to help improve the essay's structure, voice, and impact.

Selectivity Levels: Tailor the feedback by choosing one of three tiers:

Most Selective (e.g., Ivy League, UChicago, Vanderbilt)

Highly Selective (e.g., UMich, Wake Forest, UVA)

Selective (e.g., UGA, Clemson, Major Public Universities)

Flexible Input: Users can either paste their essay directly into the text area or upload a PDF document.

Word Count Tracker: An integrated word counter helps students stay within the typical 650-word limit for the Common App essay.

Responsive Design: A clean, modern, and fully responsive interface that works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

How to Use
Open the Application: Launch the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Enter Your Name (Optional): Add your name for a more personalized feedback experience.

Choose Selectivity: Select the competitiveness level of the school you're targeting from the dropdown menu.

Provide Your Essay: Paste your essay into the text box or use the "Upload PDF" button to load your essay from a file.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure of the application.

Tailwind CSS: For a utility-first approach to styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all client-side logic, including DOM manipulation and API calls.

PDF.js: A library by Mozilla to parse and extract text content from PDF files directly in the browser.

Google Gemini API: Powers the AI-driven feedback from the two distinct personas.

Deployment
This is a single-file static web application. To deploy it, simply host the index.html file on any static web hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. No server-side logic or build process is required.
